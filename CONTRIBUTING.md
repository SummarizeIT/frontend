# How to Be Awesome and Contribute to This Project

Hello there, noble coder! So, you've decided to contribute to This Project. Your contributions might just save the digital world as we know it â€“ or at least make this project a little better. Welcome to the squad of champions! ðŸš€

## Ground Rules for Heroes (a.k.a. Contributors)

Before you leap tall buildings in a single bound, there are a few ground rules to follow. Don't worry; they're easier than eating pancakes.

### Our Sacred Texts (a.k.a. GitHub Flow)

In our kingdom, we follow the sacred texts of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means all code magic happens through pull requests. Even wizards need peer reviews.

### How to Submit Your Spells (a.k.a. Pull Requests)

Contributing your magical enhancements to the codebase doesn't require a wand or mystical incantationsâ€”just a bit of git magic and a sprinkle of humor. Hereâ€™s how to enchant us with your contributions:

1. **Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.**
   - First, navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you wish to contribute to.
   - Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/SummarizeIT/Frontend.git`.
   - Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-cool-feature-name`. Make it something cool, like `feature/invisibility-cloak-enhancement`.

2. **Update the grimoire (a.k.a. documentation) if your spells change how we brew potions.**
   - If your contribution changes how things work or adds new features, update the README.md or the relevant documentation files.
   - Documentation updates can be as simple as adding a new section or as detailed as rewriting entire chapters. The goal is to make sure fellow wizards can follow along without turning themselves into newts.

3. **Ensure the test cauldron doesn't explode.**
   - Before pushing your changes, rerun all the tests to ensure everything is still working as expected.
   - This is like the final inspection of your potion before presenting it to the potion master.

4. **Keep your code as clean as a polished wand.**
   - Review your changes and make sure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
   - Remove any debugging spells or commented-out code that you used during development. They're like leftover potion ingredientsâ€”best cleaned up before someone else finds them.

5. **Open a pull request and await the council's review.**
   - Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, then go to the original repository you forked your copy from.
   - Click on "Pull Requests" and then the "New Pull Request" button. Choose your branch and compare it against the main branch of the original repository.
   - Fill in the pull request with a description of your changes, the reasons behind them, and any other relevant information.
   - Click "Create Pull Request." Your PR is now ready to be reviewed by the council of senior wizards. Await their feedback with bated breath!

Remember, patience is a virtue in both magic and software development. Responses may not be instantaneous, but your contribution to the arcane arts is greatly appreciated!


### A Bug! In My Dungeon? It's More Likely Than You Think

Found a nasty creature lurking in the code? Use GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/SummarizeIT/Frontend/issues) to let us know. Be as descriptive as a bard telling tales of old. The more we know, the faster we can send it back to the shadow realm.

### The Best Bug Reports Are Like Epic Quests

They have:

- A dramatic title
- A tale of what led to the encounter
- The spell you used (code)
- What you hoped would happen (the treasure you sought)
- What instead cursed you (the bug's effect)
- Any magical artifacts you used in vain (other attempts to solve it)

We adore detailed bug reports â€“ they're like maps to hidden treasure.

### Coding Style: The Dress Code of the Realm

- Indent with 2 spaces, not tabs. It's the difference between wearing a cape versus a potato sack.
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting your pull request. It's like combing your hair before a royal ball â€“ makes a good impression.

### License to Spellcast

By contributing your spells, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same magic spell (a.k.a. [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)) that protects the project. It's like joining a guild; your magic adds to our strength.

## Lastly...

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use your coding powers for good. Now, go forth and contribute, brave soul! Together, we shall write the legends of tomorrow.

This guide was conjured with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of seriousness. It's inspired by the countless scrolls of open-source contribution guidelines and a desire to make the world of code a bit more whimsical.
